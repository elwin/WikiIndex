            This project has been created to play around with the Wikipedia dataset. The goal is to calculate the
            distance
            between two pages, that is, how many clicks are required to get from one page to the other by only using
            the
            links on each page.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Currently only the the Simple Wikipedia has been indexed. The reason for this is that the entire index
            (containing page title + references) is stored in memory. Now, to index the English Wikipedia either
            more memory
            is required or the data needs to be partially stored on disk (or the memory footprint reduced with
            another way).
